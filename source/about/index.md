### Hi, I'm zZhiw

Welcome! Per the web address, you'll know that this is Zheng Zhi-Wei's site, that's me.
This is a personal site aimed at nothing in particular. Sometimes I go on story writing binges and others I babble on about tech or what new computer "thing" I'm learning or interested in. Overall, I use the site to keep track of what's interesting me at the moment.
I am, by most accounts, a regular married guy with two kids. And now, the bulk of my mind and time are swallowed up by my family. 

### Contact Me

eMail: [Hi@ZhengZhiWei.net](mailto://hi@zhengzhiwei.net) here is my eMail address if you need to send some verbiage.
Messaging: I also use [Telegram](https://t.me/zZhiw) for secure chat. Or if you're so inclined, you may use the below form too.
